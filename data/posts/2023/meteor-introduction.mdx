## What is MeteorJS?
Compared to other frameworks, MeteorJS is a full-stack framework. I think it's friendly for beginner to start with as Blaze is a simple template engine. It's also a good choice for small projects or your lazyness to set up a backend server.

## What is Blaze?
Blaze is a simple template engine. It's a part of MeteorJS. Blaze is only HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The reactive data binding is the most important feature of Blaze. It's easy to learn and use.

Example counter for Blaze template engine:

```html
<template name="hello">
  <button>Click Me</button>
  <p>You've pressed the button {{counter}} times.</p>
</template>
```

```javascript
Template.hello.onCreated(function helloOnCreated() {
  // counter starts at 0
  this.counter = new ReactiveVar(0);
});

Template.hello.helpers({
  counter() {
    return Template.instance().counter.get();
  },
});

Template.hello.events({
  'click button'(event, instance) {
    // increment the counter when button is clicked
    instance.counter.set(instance.counter.get() + 1);
  },
});
```

## Meteor CLI
Meteor CLI is a command line tool to create, run and deploy MeteorJS applications. It's easy to use and fast to set up a project.

```bash
meteor create myapp
cd myapp
meteor
```
