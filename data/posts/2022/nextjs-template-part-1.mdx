When starting a new project, i usually think about how to have the cleaniest as well as easy-to-read structure. I always get bored when finished setting up techs into this new project. So i decided to write this blog to help you and help me get rid of those boring process.

## Introduction

For most of the time, i seek for easy coding solutions. So in this journey you will only see things that simplified to make up your effortless coding life.

## Prerequisites

Before going further, you are expected to have a tiny tiny bit of basic knowledge of these things: 

- NodeJS
- NPM
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript

## Getting started

Let's setup NextJS with one magic command:

```
npx create-next-app --typescript nextjs-template
```

In this case i'm using pnpm, which is a package manager, so i will alternatively run this for a faster performance and a little easy on my patient: 

```
pnpx create next-app --typescript nextjs-template
```



After npx finished creating NextJS project, first of all, you will want to create `src` folder, which will contains your `pages`, `styles` directory. 



In `tsconfig.json`, let's add a relative path alias config to have a cooler developement process. 

```json
// @/tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "src/*"
      ],
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Install and setup Chakra UI

To use Chakra UI in your project, run one of these:

```
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

```
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

```
pnpm add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

After installing Chakra UI, we need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root of our application, which is `_app.tsx`: 

```tsx
// _app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

## Set up theme with Chakra UI

Chakra UI comes with an enormous customization ability. Let's use it. To get started with alternating default theme, you will need `@chakra-ui@theme-tools`

```
npm i @chakra-ui/theme-tools
```

```
yarn add @chakra-ui/theme-tools
```

```
pnpm add @chakra-ui/theme-tools
```

Now create a file to hold these themes together, let say it's `theme.ts`

```ts
// src/lib/theme.ts

import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { mode } from "@chakra-ui/theme-tools";

const colors = {
  global: {
    body: {
      bg: {
        light: "#faf4ed",
        dark: "#232136",
      },
      default: {
        light: "#575279",
        dark: "#e0def4",
      },
    },
  },
  components: {
    Drawer: {
      dialog: {
        light: "white",
        dark: "#141214",
      },
    },
  },
};

const styles = {
  global: (props: any) => ({
    body: {
      color: mode(
        colors.global.body.default.light,
        colors.global.body.default.dark
      )(props),
      bg: mode(colors.global.body.bg.light, colors.global.body.bg.dark)(props),
    },
  }),
};

const components = {
  Drawer: {
    baseStyle: (props: any) => ({
      dialog: {
        bg: mode(
          colors.components.Drawer.dialog.light,
          colors.components.Drawer.dialog.dark
        )(props),
      },
    }),
  },
};

const theme = extendTheme({
  components,
  styles,
});

export default theme;
```

In the above snippet, I imported:
- `mode`: this allow us to define colors for our themes, toggling between `light` and `dark`
- `extendTheme`: a method to add your theme to default Chakra UI foundation styles.

You can find all the foundation styles [here](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/packages/components/theme/src/foundations).

After these configurations of Chakra UI, now you can use one of their hooks to switch between color modes:

```tsx
import { useColorMode } from "@chakra-ui/react";

function Example() {
  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode()
  return (
    <header>
      <Button onClick={toggleColorMode}>
        Toggle {colorMode === 'light' ? 'Dark' : 'Light'}
      </Button>
    </header>
  )
}
```

## The end
That's it for today. New part coming soon or later is fully based on my diligent xD.

## Upcoming
Next part, probably will be last part, cover e2e testing, component isolation building, and some other misc configs.
