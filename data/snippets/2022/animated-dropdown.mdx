## Facts

There is plenty of UI library that can easily create this animation with just a component. But I want to re-create it myself to understand everything from the root.

## Foundation

First we need a state to hold the state of opening and closing of the dropdown and a button to trigger it.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

const data = [
     "Dropdown item 1",
     "Dropdown item 2",
     "Dropdown item 3",
     "Dropdown item 4",
]

export default function Dropdown() {
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Open</button>
            <div>
                {
                    data.map((item) => (
                        <div key={item}>{item}</div>
                    ))
                }
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Adding animation

Let's import motion component from framer-motion package. Then add some animation like so: 

```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useState } from "react";

const data = [
  "Dropdown item 1",
  "Dropdown item 2",
  "Dropdown item 3",
  "Dropdown item 4",
];

export default function Dropdown() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Open</button>
      <motion.div
        style={{
          overflow: "hidden",
        }}
        animate={{
            height: isOpen ? "auto" : 0
        }}
      >
        {data.map((item) => (
          <div key={item}>{item}</div>
        ))}
      </motion.div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

What changed ? 
- Normal `div` changed to `motion.div`, this allow us to access all attributes that motion component provide
- Set `style.overflow` to hidden because adding `overflow-hidden` class will not be added to style in time, so the animation will not work.
- Animate with `animate` attributes, this simply changes `height` to 0 when the dropdown is closed.

## Conclusion

There you have full control of the `dropdown` component. Any style added will heavily based on your preferences. Enjoy!
