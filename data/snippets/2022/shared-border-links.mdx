### What is framer-motion ?

Framer motion is a library that allows you to create micro interactions in your react apps. It's a great way to create a smooth transition between pages or components. For short, framer-motion will try to animate between changes in css.

Now let's not waste anymore time, let's get into the makings.

## Create a shared border for all links section

### Creating container

```ts
const Container = () => {
    const [current, setCurrent] = useState(0);
    
    return (
      <div className="grid w-full">
        <div className="flex flex-row space-x-5">
          <AnimateSharedLayout>
            {menuItems.map((item, idx) => (
              <Link
                text={item}
                key={idx}
                selected={current === idx}
                onClick={() => setCurrent(idx)}
              />
            ))}
          </AnimateSharedLayout>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
}
```

Let's brake it down a bit. 

- `AnimateSharedLayout` will try to animate between changes in css, based on the argument ```key```.
- `key` is a unique identifier for each element so that `AnimateSharedLayout` can track changes.
- `text` is the text that will be displayed in the link.
- `selected` is a boolean that will be used to determine if the link is selected or not. 

We've just created the container, let's move on to the `Link` component.

### Create Link component

```ts
type LinkProps = {
    selected: boolean;
    text: string;
    onClick: () => void
}

const Link: FC<LinkProps> = ({ selected, onClick, text }) => {
    return (
      <motion.div
        className="relative"
        onClick={onClick}
        animate={{ opacity: selected ? 1 : 0.5 }}
      >
        {text}
        {selected && <motion.div className="absolute top-full left-0 w-full h-0.5 rounded-2xl bg-red-700" layoutId="underline" />}
      </motion.div>
    );
}
```
